# JavaScript, Bootstrap, and UFOs
Overview of Project
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

### Resources and Before Start Notes:
Data Source: ufo_starterCode.js and index.html
Data Tools: ECMAScript, JavaScript, Jupyter Notebook, Python and MongoDB
Software: ES6+, ECMAScript, MongoDB, Python 3.8.3, Visual Studio Code 1.50.0

## Overview of ES6+
ECMAScript, also referred to as "ES," is a scripting language designed to help standardize JavaScript. This means that ES provides guidelines and rules for JavaScript to follow, such as how a function should be created to run correctly, also known as the proper syntax.

## JavaScript in the Real World
JavaScript is one of the powerhouse languages out in the wild today. While its strength is in creating visually appealing and dynamic content, it is starting to grow into other fields as well. Tensorflow, a popular machine learning tool, even has its own JavaScript library now.

It's pretty easy to start feeling daunted by everything JavaScript can do, so Dana is more interested in examples of similar websites—ones that use filters on lots of data.

Online shopping websites: These are a great example of dynamic content. They contain filters for departments, and then filters for items within those departments. Filters on top of filters!
Ecological data: DThe National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) has very large and diverse datasets; these are also displayed on their website as dynamic tables with multiple filters.
Weather data: (The National Snow & Ice Data Center (NSIDC) also has very large datasets presented in table format on their website. These tables include filters and parameters that can be applied to their table.
Writing JavaScript
One major component of each coding language is its syntax. For example, Python is a pretty clean and easy-to-read language; there aren't many semicolons, and the indentation and spacing makes sense. SQL, on the other hand, includes semicolons, but it also has guidelines and requirements when it comes to indentation and spacing.

JavaScript is no different: there are guidelines and requirements for writing it. But because JavaScript can be added to an HTML page, there are more guidelines and requirements than for languages that can only live in a .js file or Jupyter notebook such as Python. There are a few important things to remember about JavaScript syntax. We'll start with the following:

 - Case sensitivity
-  Semicolons
-  Statements and expressions
-  Code blocks
-  Case Sensitivity

Let's use a print statement as an example. In JavaScript, a print statement is called a console log. To print "Hello, world!" to the console, we would use this line:

// Printing a string with JavaScript
console.log("Hello, world!");
Statements and Expressions
When describing JavaScript code, the terms "statements" and "expressions" are both used, and often. Here's how to distinguish between the two:


Deliverable 1:
Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
Deliverable Requirements:
Using JavaScript and HTML, you’ll modify the code in your index.html file to create more table filters. In addition to the date filter you created in this module, you’ll add filters for the city, state, country, and shape, as shown in the following image:
